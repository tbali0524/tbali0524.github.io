# `TBali` - Personal Coding Page

A collection of my coding-related activities.

## CodinGame

* [My CG profile](https://www.codingame.com/profile/08e6e13d9f7cad047d86ec4d10c777500155033)
    * My main focus has been so far on solo I/O puzzles _(__>97%__ solved)_, but I also like to participate in multiplayer bot AI contests.
* My article on CG's blog:
    * [The Coding Adventures of a Salesperson](https://www.codingame.com/blog/salesperson-coding/) _… or how I became a Legend in 40 days_
* My playgrounds (articles) on `tech.io`:
    * [A Babel of Languages on CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/56997/a-babel-of-languages-on-codingame/intro)
    * [Swapping languages on CodinGame (a.k.a. system() calls)](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59982/swapping-languages-on-codingame-a-k-a--system-calls/intro)
    * [PHP Dev Tools (for CodinGame or elsewhere)](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/77580/php-dev-tools-for-codingame-or-elsewhere/intro)
* Public repositories:
    * [CGTest](https://github.com/tbali0524/cgtest) - a multi-language offline batch test runner for CodinGame (or other) solo I/O puzzles
        * _The repository also contains __6500+__ test cases for __870+__ `CodinGame` puzzles and __770+__ puzzle statements._
    * [codingame_api](https://github.com/tbali0524/codingame_api) - data download tool using CodinGame API

## Other coding competitions and sites

* [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - _(profile is hidden)_
    * Solved [all puzzles in the first 10 seasons](pic/aoc.png) (I used ~15 hints from reddit).
    * [Repository of my solutions in PHP](https://github.com/tbali0524/advent-of-code-solutions) (500 AoC ⭐)
    * [Repository of my solutions in Rust](https://github.com/tbali0524/advent-of-code-rust) (218 AoC ⭐)
* [Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes/) - _(profile is hidden)_
    * Only recently started, few solutions in Season 2024.
    * [Repository of my solutions in Rust](https://github.com/tbali0524/everybody-codes-rust)
* Codewars - _([my profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/tbali0524))_
    * Limited activity, ~300 katas solved.
    * Used it to practice simple puzzles and one-liners in `PHP` and `Rust`. My personal FP challenge: avoid `for` loops in my solutions.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - _([profile](https://projecteuler.net/progress=TBali) is hidden)_
    * Limited activity _([<10% of the puzzles](https://projecteuler.net/profile/TBali.png) solved)_.
* [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
    * Very limited activity so far
    * [Repository of my solutions in Rust](https://github.com/tbali0524/atcoder-rust)
* Google CodeJam
    * Participated in 2021, made it only to [round 2](pic/codejam21cert.png)... :-(
* Hackerranks - (_[my profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/TBali))_
    * _(So far only minimal activity)_
* On my TODO list:
    * Try out also these: `Codeforces`, `Kaggle`, etc.

## Aviation Fanatic website

[www.aviationfanatic.com](https://www.aviationfanatic.com) - Free online aviation encyclopedia

* I created this website in 2011, as a pet project to learn `PHP`, `MySQL`, `HTML` and `CSS`.
* Therefore, I decided NOT to use any web framework or external package, except the core language library, doing everything from scratch.
* Now it hosts 260k+ records in 20+ database tables, and 12k+ pictures (plus thumbnails).
* _On mid-term TODO list:_ complete rewrite with OOP design, using Laravel framework and Tailwind CSS. Possibly also with client-side rendering with Vue.js.

## Coding in the 90s

I used to code a lot during my high school and university years, mainly in `Turbo Pascal` _(~30k lines of code)_.

* [Repository of the programs I wrote in the 1990s](https://github.com/tbali0524/pc-coding-1990s)

## Commodore 64

It all began with the [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)...

* Captain K.O.
    * My very first program, written at the age of 12, in `C64 BASIC`. It would not pass a decent code review, I know... :-)
* [Bali's Sprite Designer v4.0](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190116)
    * My very first `assembly` program. Its first version was written at the age of 15.
* [Bali's Character Editor v2.0](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190117)
    * A font editor with pull-down menus, written in assembly.
* [C64ASM v1.1a](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190119) - a cross-assembler for the MOS6510 CPU
    * I wrote this in the '90s in [Borland Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). It runs on a PC (needs DOSEMU nowadays), but generates C64 binary files that can be run with a real C64 or with an emulator.
* [My profile on the `C64 Scene Database`](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=34229)
* [Repository of the C64 programs I wrote in 1986-91](https://github.com/tbali0524/c64-coding-1986-1991)

## Programming languages

* I consider myself fluent in `PHP`.
    * I wrote 220k+ lines of code (as a hobby).
    * Beginner level in the `Laravel` framework.
* I used to be fluent in `Pascal` and `C64 assembly` in the 90s, but I have mostly forgotten it since.
* Nowadays I am spending some time in getting better and practicing `Rust`.
* Low-intermediate level in `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Javascript` / `Typescript`, `Python`
    * I spent some time learning these languages, but have only little coding experience in these.
    * I am able to read/understand code and to write simple stuff.
* I also tried out many other languages (mainly on CodinGame, with < 2k total lines of code per language), so I am at very beginner level in these.
* My LoC stats as of `2024.12.27`:
