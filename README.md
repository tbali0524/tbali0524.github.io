# `TBali` - Personal Coding Page

A collection of my coding-related activities.

## CodinGame

My main focus was so far on solo I/O puzzles (_now ~98% completed_), but I also like to write AI bots for multiplayer competitions (either using some heuristics or a proper simulation and a search algorithm.)

* [The Coding Adventures of a Salesperson](https://www.codingame.com/blog/salesperson-coding/) _â€¦ or how I became a Legend in 40 days_
    * My article on CG's blog.
* My playgrounds (articles) on tech.io:
    * [A Babel of Languages on CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/56997/a-babel-of-languages-on-codingame/intro)
    * [Swapping languages on CodinGame (a.k.a. system() calls)](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59982/swapping-languages-on-codingame-a-k-a--system-calls/intro)
    * [PHP Dev Tools (for CodinGame or elsewhere)](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/77580/php-dev-tools-for-codingame-or-elsewhere/intro)
* Public repositories:
    * [CGTest](https://github.com/tbali0524/cgtest) - a multi-language offline batch test runner for CodinGame (or other) solo I/O puzzles
    * [codingame_api](https://github.com/tbali0524/codingame_api) - data download tool using CodinGame API

## Aviation Fanatic website

[www.aviationfanatic.com](https://www.aviationfanatic.com) - Free online aviation encyclopedia

* I created this website in 2011, as a pet project to learn `PHP`, `MySQL`, `HTML` and `CSS`.
* Therefore, I decided NOT to use any web framework or external package, except the core language library, doing everything from scratch. It is not using any OOP.
* Now it hosts 260k+ records in 20+ database tables, and 12k+ pictures (plus thumbnails).
* _Mid-term plan:_ complete rewrite with OOP design, using Laravel framework and Tailwind CSS. Possibly also with client-side rendering with Vue.js.

## Commodore 64

It all began with the [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)...

* [Captain K.O.](CAPTNKO.T64)
    * My very first program, written at the age of 11, in `C64 BASIC`. It would not pass a decent code review, I know... :-)
* [Bali's Sprite Designer v4.0](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190116)
    * My very first `assembly` program. Its first version was written at the age of 15.
* [Bali's Character Editor v2.0](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190117)
    * A font editor with pull-down menus, written in assembly.
* [C64ASM v1.1a](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190119) - a cross-assembler for the MOS6510 CPU
    * I wrote this in the '90s in [Borland Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). It runs on a PC (needs DOSEMU nowadays), but generates C64 binary files that can be run with a real C64 or with an emulator.

## Other coding competitions and sites

* [My Codewars profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/tbali0524)
    * Only recently started. Using it to practice simple puzzles and one-liners in `PHP` and `Rust`. My personal FP challenge: avoid `for` loops in my solutions.
* [My Project Euler profile](https://projecteuler.net/progress=TBali)
    * Only recently started.
* [Google CodeJam 2021](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/certificate/summary/00000000004360f1) 
    * I made it only to round 2... :-(
* On my __TODO__ list only:
    * Try out also these: `TopCoder`, `Kaggle`, `Advent Of Code`, etc.

## Programming languages

* I consider myself fluent in `PHP`.
    * Beginner level in the `Laravel` framework.
* I used to be fluent in `Pascal` and `C64 assembly` in the 90s, but I have mostly forgotten it since.
* I spent some time learning some other languages, but have only little coding experience in these. I am able to read code and write simple stuff.
    * `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `JavaScript` / `Typescript`, `Python`, `Rust`, etc.

## Professional

I have been working in the ICT industry for 25+ years, but never as a software developer.

* [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tothbalint/)
* [My blog articles at Intalion](https://www.intalion.hu/author/toth_balint/) _(in Hungarian)_
    * I am working at Intalion for 5+ years now.
